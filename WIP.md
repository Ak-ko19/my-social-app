# WIP — current work (see MONTH_PLAN.md for the full plan)

**Day:** 58 — Accessibility + translations check
**Step:** 3 — open states: done (committed). Modal now keeps Tab inside and gives focus back to its opener; e2e/day58-open-states.cjs (50 checks, EN light 390 + AR dark 375; 14 of them fail on the old Modal). Next: close Day 58 (full browser run in batches, perf, tick MONTH_PLAN, Progress Log, WIP -> Day 59).

## Carry-over notes
- GO LIVE is an owner action (no production access): GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md,
  LATER.md #2. Before each future GO LIVE day, run
  `cd e2e && bash golive-rehearsal.sh --old` (it picks up new migrations
  and checks the checklist's migration list).
- Any new migration: up + down files, update tests/fixtures/schema.sql
  (+ testDb TABLES), GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST loop, and the rehearsal must pass.
- Never chain a commit after a check without gating on its result
  (Day 55 slip: a red backend run got committed).
- Logging: use utils/logger (a test forbids console.* in backend
  sources); 500s via sendServerError so they reach the error log.
- Suites that need the production build go in DIST_SUITES (run-all.sh);
  ones that need the real bot checks in BOT_SUITES; Turnstile-on ones in
  TURNSTILE_SUITES; Day 49: ones needing the spam checks in SPAM_SUITES
  (SPAM_CHECKS_IN_TESTS=1, off for every other suite).
- Day 11: bot checks (form token, honeypot, login delay) are OFF under
  NODE_ENV=test unless BOT_CHECKS_IN_TESTS=1. Suites that sign users up
  straight through the API only work on the default stack.
- Tip: `E2E_FRONTEND=dist bash run-all.sh` runs the browser suites on the
  production build with vercel.json's real headers.
- GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST edits: use the Edit tool, never a node/heredoc
  script — `\n` inside a quoted heredoc lands as a literal "\n" (bit
  twice, Days 10 and 12; the rehearsal catches it).
- Mutation checks edit backend files: never run them while a browser
  stack is starting (Day 12 crash). Jest files that send many DMs:
  `beforeEach(resetMessageRateLimits)` (services/rateLimiter.js).
- Playwright gotcha seen 4× now: getByRole/getByLabel/getByText name
  matching is a SUBSTRING match — use `exact: true` when one label is
  contained in another.

- This machine has 8 GB RAM (~2 GB free): run long browser runs in
  the foreground in E2E_ONLY batches; a background run got killed.

- Follow-up from Day 16: routes have no auth guard; auth-only screens
  (Admin, EditPage, ManageCommunity, …) re-render briefly with no token
  on a forced logout. Consider a route-level guard (Day 20 a11y/quality
  or Day 25 security round).
- Explore: trending tags are cached 60 s in memory (Day 40, N3; off
  under NODE_ENV=test unless TRENDING_CACHE_MS is set). Popular posts
  still aggregate 7 days per request (~5.7k rows at the perf seed; per-
  viewer visibility, so not shared) -- revisit at real scale.
- Performance: e2e/day27-perf.cjs must stay green; new list queries get
  an index (check with the suite). Any new index goes in the migration,
  the fixture AND the rehearsal compares them. npm run check:bundle
  keeps the first download under 225 kB gz.
- Privacy Policy (legal.privacy in the locales) is written from the
  code: when a feature changes what is collected, shared or kept,
  update it (EN/AR) and its date in LegalScreen.jsx.
- UI languages = EN + AR only (2026-10-07, MONTH_PLAN rule 14). A new
  user-facing server message needs an Arabic line in
  frontend/src/i18n/serverMessages.ar.js -- check:i18n scans the backend
  (res.status().send, { error }, XxxError(status, '...')) and fails
  otherwise; developer-only texts follow its DEV_ONLY rules. New emails:
  config/emailText.js (en + ar).
- Cloudinary: a new upload folder must be added to
  scripts/cloudinary-orphans.js APP_FOLDERS (a test checks), and any new
  column holding a file URL to its referencedKeys (else the scan deletes
  it!).
- New account-only screens: wrap their route in authOnly() in App.jsx
  and add them to e2e/day30-guard.cjs GUARDED.
- Accessibility: e2e/day26-a11y.cjs must stay at 0 serious/critical.
  Accent colour as TEXT uses --color-accent-text (lighter in dark mode),
  never --color-accent.

- Day 30 Privacy Policy: mention that the server fetches linked pages
  for previews (sites see our server, not the reader) and that share
  cards show public posts to link-preview crawlers.

- Follow-up (seen Day 40): post cards never show a comment count until
  the comments are opened (PostCard comment: lists return no
  comment_count). FB/IG show "N comments" up front -- an app-wide change
  for a later polish day.

- Edit/Write tools can DECODE \uXXXX escapes in code you write (Day 43:
  a regex /[က-႟]/ landed as literal Burmese). After writing
  such code, check with `grep -n ... | od -c`; to fix, build the
  backslash with String.fromCharCode(92) in a script.
- Full browser run timing: day27-perf and the A3 matrix each need most
  of a 10-minute tool call. Run day27-perf alone, and A3 one language
  at a time (`A3_LANG=xx timeout 500 node a3-visual.cjs` on a fresh
  e2e-up.sh -- one language takes ~5 min).
- Time-based work (Day 45): add a job to services/ticker.js JOBS (30 s +
  start-up; take rows FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED so several instances are
  safe) and to cleanupService.run as the backstop.
- Notifications about your own content (no other actor):
  notificationService.notifySystem / SYSTEM_TYPES, pushText (en+ar), and
  a key in Notifications.jsx notificationKey + notifications.types.
- Native browser controls speak the BROWSER's language (file picker
  text, required/min/max bubbles): use translated buttons and our own
  checks (Day 45: CreatePost, EditProfile).
- New ways to create a post go through services/postCreationService.
- Saved-post listings use services/savedPostsService (one visibility
  query). Arabic: a collection is "قائمة"; "مجموعة" means a group.
- Who may see a post: postVisibilityService.getVisiblePost (one post)
  and postAudienceSql (listings) -- never copy the audience rule. Muted
  (muteService.notMutedSql) applies to Home/stories/Explore only;
  restricted people never notify (notify(), mentions, pushes).
- Direct-message rules live in messageService.assertNotBlocked (every
  send) + interactionService; a new send path must call it.
- Never put a commit in the same batch as the checks it depends on.
- Browser runs: ONE run-all/A3 at a time -- two in parallel fail with
  "run-all.sh: No such file" (seen twice on Day 47).
- Polls (Day 44): a new post listing must add pollColumnSql(viewer)
  next to mediaColumnSql (polls.test lists every listing).
- Burmese CONTENT (Day 43; kept after the 2026-10-07 EN/AR-only UI
  decision -- content stays any-language): new free-text fields go through
  utils/myanmarText toUnicode (check limits on the text as typed, or
  the converted text when the column is varchar), and get a row in
  scripts/convert-zawgyi.js COLUMNS (a test lists them). Hashtag /
  mention regexes are [\p{L}\p{M}\p{N}_] with the u flag on both sides.

- Full browser run: run it in batches of about five suites
  (`E2E_ONLY="a b c d e" bash run-all.sh`), not all at once. The
  machine ran low on memory during a one-shot run on Day 48.

- Day 49: suites that need the spam checks go in SPAM_SUITES
  (SPAM_CHECKS_IN_TESTS=1); every other suite posts freely.
- Hidden words is on (warn) for every account by default: test content
  with words from frontend/src/data/offensiveWords.js gets covered.

- Bundle: first download 220.5 / 225 kB (Day 50 moved the Arabic server
  messages out). Watch it; lazy-load anything big.
- Shell gotcha: never put JS template literals (backticks) or $1 inside
  a node -e "..." or heredoc edit -- bash eats them. Use the Edit tool.


- Backend test logs go in the scratchpad, never outside the project
  (writing ../../be-run.txt was refused on Day 55).

- A picked photo now shows after it is shrunk (Day 57): browser suites
  must wait for .image-picker-item before checking the composer.

## Plan
What's already enforced: check:i18n (every key in EN and AR, plurals,
no English copies in AR, Arabic for server messages), day26-a11y (axe
on 117 resting pages in both themes), A3 (every page, EN/AR, 375px).
What nothing catches yet, one automated check each:
- Step 1 Text that skips t(): scripts/check-hardcoded-text.cjs scans
  frontend/src JSX for text children and aria-label / placeholder /
  title / alt string literals containing letters. Fix what it finds;
  run it inside check:i18n so CI keeps it.
- Step 2 Left/right CSS: scan every .css for physical properties
  (margin-left, padding-right, left:, right:, text-align: left/right,
  border-left...) that should be logical (inline-start/end). Fix them;
  same CI hook.
- Step 3 Open states: axe on dialogs, menus, sheets and pickers (the
  resting-page suite never opens them) in AR dark 375 and EN light;
  keyboard: Escape closes, focus returns, Tab stays inside.

## Progress
- Step 1 done: scripts/check-hardcoded-text.cjs (espree AST): JSX text,
  aria-label / placeholder / title / alt and our components' text props
  (label, description, message, confirmLabel...), and setError('...')-
  style setters (a single camelCase word counts as a state). Skips test
  files and data-i18n="skip" subtrees. Part of `npm run check:i18n`
  (so CI). It found nothing real: the bot honeypot's "Website" and the
  landing page's sample username were marked skip. A Vitest test runs it
  on fixtures (6 kinds caught, states / t() / skip / tests passed).
  Verified: Vitest 260, backend 868, check:i18n, lint, c3-landing,
  day11-bots.
- Step 2 done: scripts/check-rtl-css.cjs (in check:i18n): margin /
  padding / border -left/-right, left: / right:, corner radii, text-align
  / float left/right, and translateX (not translateX(0)); [dir] override
  rules and /* rtl-ok: why */ lines pass; comments ignored; one-line
  rules split by declaration. The CSS was already logical: the only
  physical rule was the always-LTR stack trace (now `start`, same
  effect); three already-mirrored animations got rtl-ok notes. Vitest
  test on fixtures. Verified: Vitest 262, backend 868, bundle 220.5,
  check:i18n, lint, b16-rtl, b11-settings, day12-review.
