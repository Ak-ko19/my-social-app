# WIP — current work (see MONTH_PLAN.md for the full plan)

**Day:** 53–54 — Pages (basic)
**Step:** 1 — page admins: done (committed). Next: step 2, the Pages list (split + paging).

## Carry-over notes
- GO LIVE is an owner action (no production access): GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md,
  LATER.md #2. Before each future GO LIVE day, run
  `cd e2e && bash golive-rehearsal.sh --old` (it picks up new migrations
  and checks the checklist's migration list).
- Any new migration: up + down files, update tests/fixtures/schema.sql
  (+ testDb TABLES), GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST loop, and the rehearsal must pass.
- Logging: use utils/logger (a test forbids console.* in backend
  sources); 500s via sendServerError so they reach the error log.
- Suites that need the production build go in DIST_SUITES (run-all.sh);
  ones that need the real bot checks in BOT_SUITES; Turnstile-on ones in
  TURNSTILE_SUITES; Day 49: ones needing the spam checks in SPAM_SUITES
  (SPAM_CHECKS_IN_TESTS=1, off for every other suite).
- Day 11: bot checks (form token, honeypot, login delay) are OFF under
  NODE_ENV=test unless BOT_CHECKS_IN_TESTS=1. Suites that sign users up
  straight through the API only work on the default stack.
- Tip: `E2E_FRONTEND=dist bash run-all.sh` runs the browser suites on the
  production build with vercel.json's real headers.
- GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST edits: use the Edit tool, never a node/heredoc
  script — `\n` inside a quoted heredoc lands as a literal "\n" (bit
  twice, Days 10 and 12; the rehearsal catches it).
- Mutation checks edit backend files: never run them while a browser
  stack is starting (Day 12 crash). Jest files that send many DMs:
  `beforeEach(resetMessageRateLimits)` (services/rateLimiter.js).
- Playwright gotcha seen 4× now: getByRole/getByLabel/getByText name
  matching is a SUBSTRING match — use `exact: true` when one label is
  contained in another.

- This machine has 8 GB RAM (~2 GB free): run long browser runs in
  the foreground in E2E_ONLY batches; a background run got killed.

- Follow-up from Day 16: routes have no auth guard; auth-only screens
  (Admin, EditPage, ManageCommunity, …) re-render briefly with no token
  on a forced logout. Consider a route-level guard (Day 20 a11y/quality
  or Day 25 security round).
- Explore: trending tags are cached 60 s in memory (Day 40, N3; off
  under NODE_ENV=test unless TRENDING_CACHE_MS is set). Popular posts
  still aggregate 7 days per request (~5.7k rows at the perf seed; per-
  viewer visibility, so not shared) -- revisit at real scale.
- Performance: e2e/day27-perf.cjs must stay green; new list queries get
  an index (check with the suite). Any new index goes in the migration,
  the fixture AND the rehearsal compares them. npm run check:bundle
  keeps the first download under 225 kB gz.
- Privacy Policy (legal.privacy in the locales) is written from the
  code: when a feature changes what is collected, shared or kept,
  update it (EN/AR) and its date in LegalScreen.jsx.
- UI languages = EN + AR only (2026-10-07, MONTH_PLAN rule 14). A new
  user-facing server message needs an Arabic line in
  frontend/src/i18n/serverMessages.ar.js -- check:i18n scans the backend
  (res.status().send, { error }, XxxError(status, '...')) and fails
  otherwise; developer-only texts follow its DEV_ONLY rules. New emails:
  config/emailText.js (en + ar).
- Cloudinary: a new upload folder must be added to
  scripts/cloudinary-orphans.js APP_FOLDERS (a test checks), and any new
  column holding a file URL to its referencedKeys (else the scan deletes
  it!).
- New account-only screens: wrap their route in authOnly() in App.jsx
  and add them to e2e/day30-guard.cjs GUARDED.
- Accessibility: e2e/day26-a11y.cjs must stay at 0 serious/critical.
  Accent colour as TEXT uses --color-accent-text (lighter in dark mode),
  never --color-accent.

- Day 30 Privacy Policy: mention that the server fetches linked pages
  for previews (sites see our server, not the reader) and that share
  cards show public posts to link-preview crawlers.

- Follow-up (seen Day 40): post cards never show a comment count until
  the comments are opened (PostCard comment: lists return no
  comment_count). FB/IG show "N comments" up front -- an app-wide change
  for a later polish day.

- Edit/Write tools can DECODE \uXXXX escapes in code you write (Day 43:
  a regex /[က-႟]/ landed as literal Burmese). After writing
  such code, check with `grep -n ... | od -c`; to fix, build the
  backslash with String.fromCharCode(92) in a script.
- Full browser run timing: day27-perf and the A3 matrix each need most
  of a 10-minute tool call. Run day27-perf alone, and A3 one language
  at a time (`A3_LANG=xx timeout 500 node a3-visual.cjs` on a fresh
  e2e-up.sh -- one language takes ~5 min).
- Time-based work (Day 45): add a job to services/ticker.js JOBS (30 s +
  start-up; take rows FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED so several instances are
  safe) and to cleanupService.run as the backstop.
- Notifications about your own content (no other actor):
  notificationService.notifySystem / SYSTEM_TYPES, pushText (en+ar), and
  a key in Notifications.jsx notificationKey + notifications.types.
- Native browser controls speak the BROWSER's language (file picker
  text, required/min/max bubbles): use translated buttons and our own
  checks (Day 45: CreatePost, EditProfile).
- New ways to create a post go through services/postCreationService.
- Saved-post listings use services/savedPostsService (one visibility
  query). Arabic: a collection is "قائمة"; "مجموعة" means a group.
- Who may see a post: postVisibilityService.getVisiblePost (one post)
  and postAudienceSql (listings) -- never copy the audience rule. Muted
  (muteService.notMutedSql) applies to Home/stories/Explore only;
  restricted people never notify (notify(), mentions, pushes).
- Direct-message rules live in messageService.assertNotBlocked (every
  send) + interactionService; a new send path must call it.
- Never put a commit in the same batch as the checks it depends on.
- Browser runs: ONE run-all/A3 at a time -- two in parallel fail with
  "run-all.sh: No such file" (seen twice on Day 47).
- Polls (Day 44): a new post listing must add pollColumnSql(viewer)
  next to mediaColumnSql (polls.test lists every listing).
- Burmese CONTENT (Day 43; kept after the 2026-10-07 EN/AR-only UI
  decision -- content stays any-language): new free-text fields go through
  utils/myanmarText toUnicode (check limits on the text as typed, or
  the converted text when the column is varchar), and get a row in
  scripts/convert-zawgyi.js COLUMNS (a test lists them). Hashtag /
  mention regexes are [\p{L}\p{M}\p{N}_] with the u flag on both sides.

- Full browser run: run it in batches of about five suites
  (`E2E_ONLY="a b c d e" bash run-all.sh`), not all at once. The
  machine ran low on memory during a one-shot run on Day 48.

- Day 49: suites that need the spam checks go in SPAM_SUITES
  (SPAM_CHECKS_IN_TESTS=1); every other suite posts freely.
- Hidden words is on (warn) for every account by default: test content
  with words from frontend/src/data/offensiveWords.js gets covered.

- Bundle: first download 218.2 / 225 kB (Day 50 moved the Arabic server
  messages out). Watch it; lazy-load anything big.
- Day 53-54: GET /pages builds owned / following / discover from one
  top-N query, like groups did before Day 50 -- yours can drop out with
  enough pages. Split it the same way.
- Shell gotcha: never put JS template literals (backticks) or $1 inside
  a node -e "..." or heredoc edit -- bash eats them. Use the Edit tool.

## Plan
Audit (2026-10-11): B14 has create, edit, delete, follow, post as page
(owner only), page posts in followers' feeds. Missing: page admins.
- Step 1 Page admins (Facebook's Page roles, simplified to owner +
  admins): migration 063 page_admins (page_id, user_id, added_by,
  created_at). The owner adds people by username and removes them; an
  admin may leave. Admins edit the page, post as it, and edit / delete
  its posts. Only the owner deletes the page and manages admins.
  - Page posts keep posts.user_id = the page's OWNER (B14's rule: blocks,
    visibility and account deletion rest on it) even when an admin
    writes them; drafts / scheduled posts check the person who made
    them is still an admin when they go up.
  - Not addable: yourself, the owner, deactivated accounts, anyone with
    a block either way. Max 20 admins.
  - UI: Edit page > Admins (add by username, remove; Leave for an
    admin); the page and composer treat admins like the owner.
- Step 2 Pages list: GET /pages builds owned / following / discover
  from one top-100 query (yours can drop out). Split into queries,
  "Pages you manage" includes admin pages, paged with Load more.
- Step 3 Notification "X made you an admin of P" (notifications.page_id,
  Groups-style category "pages"), push EN/AR, opens the page.

## Progress
- Step 1 done: migration 063 page_admins,
  services/pageAdminService.js (managesPage / managesPageSql, MAX 20),
  GET/POST/DELETE /pages/:id/admins, is_admin on pages, admins edit the
  page (loadManagedPage) and post as it (checkAudience), page posts
  inserted as the OWNER, admins edit/delete page posts, export
  pages.admin_of. pageAdmins.test.js 7, 17 mutations caught, drafts test
  + Arabic updated for the new message, rehearsal 015 -> 063.
  UI: page actions and post menu for admins (canManagePage), Edit page
  > Admins (components/pages/PageAdminsSection: add by username,
  remove, Leave; Delete page owner-only). Verified: backend 833, Vitest
  235, lint, check:i18n 1229, bundle 218.4, browser day53-page-admins
  11/11, b14-pages (owner-only text updated), day24-report-places,
  day45-drafts, day26-a11y, day30-guard, A3 ar + en (276 each).
