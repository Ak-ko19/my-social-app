# WIP — current work (see MONTH_PLAN.md for the full plan)

**Day:** 55–56 — Events (basic)
**Step:** 1 — events API: done (committed). Next: step 2, events UI.

## Carry-over notes
- GO LIVE is an owner action (no production access): GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md,
  LATER.md #2. Before each future GO LIVE day, run
  `cd e2e && bash golive-rehearsal.sh --old` (it picks up new migrations
  and checks the checklist's migration list).
- Any new migration: up + down files, update tests/fixtures/schema.sql
  (+ testDb TABLES), GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST loop, and the rehearsal must pass.
- Logging: use utils/logger (a test forbids console.* in backend
  sources); 500s via sendServerError so they reach the error log.
- Suites that need the production build go in DIST_SUITES (run-all.sh);
  ones that need the real bot checks in BOT_SUITES; Turnstile-on ones in
  TURNSTILE_SUITES; Day 49: ones needing the spam checks in SPAM_SUITES
  (SPAM_CHECKS_IN_TESTS=1, off for every other suite).
- Day 11: bot checks (form token, honeypot, login delay) are OFF under
  NODE_ENV=test unless BOT_CHECKS_IN_TESTS=1. Suites that sign users up
  straight through the API only work on the default stack.
- Tip: `E2E_FRONTEND=dist bash run-all.sh` runs the browser suites on the
  production build with vercel.json's real headers.
- GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST edits: use the Edit tool, never a node/heredoc
  script — `\n` inside a quoted heredoc lands as a literal "\n" (bit
  twice, Days 10 and 12; the rehearsal catches it).
- Mutation checks edit backend files: never run them while a browser
  stack is starting (Day 12 crash). Jest files that send many DMs:
  `beforeEach(resetMessageRateLimits)` (services/rateLimiter.js).
- Playwright gotcha seen 4× now: getByRole/getByLabel/getByText name
  matching is a SUBSTRING match — use `exact: true` when one label is
  contained in another.

- This machine has 8 GB RAM (~2 GB free): run long browser runs in
  the foreground in E2E_ONLY batches; a background run got killed.

- Follow-up from Day 16: routes have no auth guard; auth-only screens
  (Admin, EditPage, ManageCommunity, …) re-render briefly with no token
  on a forced logout. Consider a route-level guard (Day 20 a11y/quality
  or Day 25 security round).
- Explore: trending tags are cached 60 s in memory (Day 40, N3; off
  under NODE_ENV=test unless TRENDING_CACHE_MS is set). Popular posts
  still aggregate 7 days per request (~5.7k rows at the perf seed; per-
  viewer visibility, so not shared) -- revisit at real scale.
- Performance: e2e/day27-perf.cjs must stay green; new list queries get
  an index (check with the suite). Any new index goes in the migration,
  the fixture AND the rehearsal compares them. npm run check:bundle
  keeps the first download under 225 kB gz.
- Privacy Policy (legal.privacy in the locales) is written from the
  code: when a feature changes what is collected, shared or kept,
  update it (EN/AR) and its date in LegalScreen.jsx.
- UI languages = EN + AR only (2026-10-07, MONTH_PLAN rule 14). A new
  user-facing server message needs an Arabic line in
  frontend/src/i18n/serverMessages.ar.js -- check:i18n scans the backend
  (res.status().send, { error }, XxxError(status, '...')) and fails
  otherwise; developer-only texts follow its DEV_ONLY rules. New emails:
  config/emailText.js (en + ar).
- Cloudinary: a new upload folder must be added to
  scripts/cloudinary-orphans.js APP_FOLDERS (a test checks), and any new
  column holding a file URL to its referencedKeys (else the scan deletes
  it!).
- New account-only screens: wrap their route in authOnly() in App.jsx
  and add them to e2e/day30-guard.cjs GUARDED.
- Accessibility: e2e/day26-a11y.cjs must stay at 0 serious/critical.
  Accent colour as TEXT uses --color-accent-text (lighter in dark mode),
  never --color-accent.

- Day 30 Privacy Policy: mention that the server fetches linked pages
  for previews (sites see our server, not the reader) and that share
  cards show public posts to link-preview crawlers.

- Follow-up (seen Day 40): post cards never show a comment count until
  the comments are opened (PostCard comment: lists return no
  comment_count). FB/IG show "N comments" up front -- an app-wide change
  for a later polish day.

- Edit/Write tools can DECODE \uXXXX escapes in code you write (Day 43:
  a regex /[က-႟]/ landed as literal Burmese). After writing
  such code, check with `grep -n ... | od -c`; to fix, build the
  backslash with String.fromCharCode(92) in a script.
- Full browser run timing: day27-perf and the A3 matrix each need most
  of a 10-minute tool call. Run day27-perf alone, and A3 one language
  at a time (`A3_LANG=xx timeout 500 node a3-visual.cjs` on a fresh
  e2e-up.sh -- one language takes ~5 min).
- Time-based work (Day 45): add a job to services/ticker.js JOBS (30 s +
  start-up; take rows FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED so several instances are
  safe) and to cleanupService.run as the backstop.
- Notifications about your own content (no other actor):
  notificationService.notifySystem / SYSTEM_TYPES, pushText (en+ar), and
  a key in Notifications.jsx notificationKey + notifications.types.
- Native browser controls speak the BROWSER's language (file picker
  text, required/min/max bubbles): use translated buttons and our own
  checks (Day 45: CreatePost, EditProfile).
- New ways to create a post go through services/postCreationService.
- Saved-post listings use services/savedPostsService (one visibility
  query). Arabic: a collection is "قائمة"; "مجموعة" means a group.
- Who may see a post: postVisibilityService.getVisiblePost (one post)
  and postAudienceSql (listings) -- never copy the audience rule. Muted
  (muteService.notMutedSql) applies to Home/stories/Explore only;
  restricted people never notify (notify(), mentions, pushes).
- Direct-message rules live in messageService.assertNotBlocked (every
  send) + interactionService; a new send path must call it.
- Never put a commit in the same batch as the checks it depends on.
- Browser runs: ONE run-all/A3 at a time -- two in parallel fail with
  "run-all.sh: No such file" (seen twice on Day 47).
- Polls (Day 44): a new post listing must add pollColumnSql(viewer)
  next to mediaColumnSql (polls.test lists every listing).
- Burmese CONTENT (Day 43; kept after the 2026-10-07 EN/AR-only UI
  decision -- content stays any-language): new free-text fields go through
  utils/myanmarText toUnicode (check limits on the text as typed, or
  the converted text when the column is varchar), and get a row in
  scripts/convert-zawgyi.js COLUMNS (a test lists them). Hashtag /
  mention regexes are [\p{L}\p{M}\p{N}_] with the u flag on both sides.

- Full browser run: run it in batches of about five suites
  (`E2E_ONLY="a b c d e" bash run-all.sh`), not all at once. The
  machine ran low on memory during a one-shot run on Day 48.

- Day 49: suites that need the spam checks go in SPAM_SUITES
  (SPAM_CHECKS_IN_TESTS=1); every other suite posts freely.
- Hidden words is on (warn) for every account by default: test content
  with words from frontend/src/data/offensiveWords.js gets covered.

- Bundle: first download 218.2 / 225 kB (Day 50 moved the Arabic server
  messages out). Watch it; lazy-load anything big.
- Shell gotcha: never put JS template literals (backticks) or $1 inside
  a node -e "..." or heredoc edit -- bash eats them. Use the Edit tool.


## Plan
Facebook Events, basic. Nothing exists yet. Three slices:
- Step 1 API (migration 065):
  - events (id, host_id cascade, name <=100, description <=2000,
    starts_at, ends_at null and after starts_at, location <=200 free
    text, audience 'public' | 'followers', cancelled_at,
    reminder_sent_at, created_at); event_responses (event_id, user_id,
    'going' | 'interested', created_at).
  - Indexes: starts_at for upcoming, host_id, responses by user, and a
    partial index for reminders that are due.
  - Who sees an event: as posts do. A deactivated host's events are
    hidden, a block either way hides them, and "followers" means the
    host's accepted followers (and the host).
  - POST /events, GET /events/:id (+ going / interested counts, your
    response, is_host), PATCH (host; a new time re-arms the reminder),
    POST /events/:id/cancel (host), DELETE (host),
    PUT/DELETE /events/:id/response, GET /events/:id/guests?status=,
    GET /events?section=mine|discover (mine = hosting or responded,
    upcoming first; discover = public upcoming events you can see,
    soonest first). Everything paged.
  - Rules: start in the future when created (up to a year ahead), no
    responding to a cancelled or finished event, spam-like limits via
    the global limiter.
- Step 2 UI: Menu > Events (/events: Upcoming / Discover tabs), Create
  (/events/new: name, start, end, location, details, audience; time
  zone shown), event page (/events/:id: date, host, place, details,
  Going / Interested, guests, host: Edit, Cancel, Delete), Edit.
  EN/AR, RTL, dark, a11y; browser suite.
- Step 3 reminders and notifications (migration 066:
  notifications.event_id, notification_preferences.events): the ticker
  reminds Going / Interested people an hour before ("<event> starts at
  <time>"; skipped if the server slept past the start). The host
  cancelling tells them. Push EN/AR, plus an Events settings switch.

## Progress
- Step 1 done: migration 065 (events, event_responses + indexes),
  controllers/eventController.js, routes/eventRoutes.js (POST /events,
  GET /events?section=mine|discover, GET/PATCH/DELETE /events/:id,
  POST /events/:id/cancel, PUT/DELETE /events/:id/response,
  GET /events/:id/guests?status=). Visibility like posts (deactivated
  host, blocks, followers = accepted). Export events.hosted / responses;
  Privacy Policy EN/AR. events.test.js 11, 20 mutations caught, backend
  850, rehearsal 015 -> 065, browser day28-export + c2-legal.
